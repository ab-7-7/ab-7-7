## Hi there 👋, I am Nzinga Abdias Masamba

---

I am Abdias Masamba, a Software Engineering student at CodeSpace. I come from a background in customer service and sales, where I developed strong people skills, and along the way, I discovered a real passion for web design and software development. That passion led me to pursue a formal path in Software Engineering, which I’m on track to complete by March 2026.

My current focus is building a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also bring strengths in people management, time management, communication, active listening, and technical support. Finishing my course is my top priority; it’s the next step toward breaking into the tech industry and achieving my long-term goal of becoming a software developer.
